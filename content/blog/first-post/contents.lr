body: I built this site to document my various projects, using [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/). Definitely a bit more complex than a simple [Google Site](https://gsuite.google.com/products/sites/), or even [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), but it looks fun and interesting. We shall see.
